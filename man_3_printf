.SH NAME
.PP
.B _printf
- format and print data in the standard output

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
To use this function the #include "main.h" header file is needed.
.sp
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The function printf() writes output to
.I stdout,
the standard output stream. It writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

.SS Return Value
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %.
%c  For print a single character
%s  For print a string of characters
%d  For print a decimal (base 10) number
%i  For print an integer a base 10 number
%%  For print a sing
%r  For print the reversed string

.SH RETURN VALUES
The _printf() function returns an integer representing the number of symbols
printed not counting \\0 for the string.
